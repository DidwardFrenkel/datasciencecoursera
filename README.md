####The run\_analysis.R file starts by getting the required data from the relevant repositories and then runs them to obtain the raw data. Some of the raw data is separated by double spaces, generating NA entries in the raw data, or even by arbitrarily placed newlines. The tidy data is obtained by combining these broken rows and filtering out the NA's created by double-spacing.
####After we have cleaned the basic data, we cbind the x, y, and subject training and test data sets, and then rbind the newly combined training and test data sets to form a single table. We then put names into the table to describe our data and use grepl to obtain the mean and standard deviations of each entry. We finish off by saving the new file in a jpg.
